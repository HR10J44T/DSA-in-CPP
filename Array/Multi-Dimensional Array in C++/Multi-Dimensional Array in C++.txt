Multi-Dimensional Array in C++
Explanation:-
A multi-dimensional array in C++ is an array of arrays. The simplest form is the two-dimensional array, which can be visualized as a matrix with rows and columns.

Working:-
1.Declaration: Defining the array with multiple dimensions.
2.Initialization: Assigning values to the elements.
3.Accessing Elements: Using multiple indices to retrieve or modify elements.

Practice Questions
1.Declare a 2x3 matrix and initialize it with values. Print the matrix.
2.Modify the element at the second row and third column to 99. Print the modified matrix.
3.Write a function to compute the transpose of a 2x2 matrix.
