One-Dimensional Array in C++
Explanation:-
A one-dimensional array in C++ is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows you to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

Working:-
1.Declaration: Defining the array and its size.
2.Initialization: Assigning values to the array elements.
3.Accessing Elements: Using the index to retrieve or modify elements.

Practice Questions:-
1.Declare an array of size 5 and initialize it with the values 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Print the array.
2.Modify the third element of the array to 100. Print the modified array.
3.Write a function to find the maximum value in a one-dimensional array.
