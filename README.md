## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of data structures (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.) and algorithms (such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.) implemented in C++. Each implementation includes detailed comments and explanations to help you understand the logic behind them.

## Features

- Comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms.
- Well-documented code with comments explaining each step.
- Examples and test cases for each data structure and algorithm.
- Easy-to-follow structure and naming conventions.
- Regular updates and improvements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HR10J44T/dsa-in-cpp.git

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
Git
Installation
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd dsa-in-cpp

Compile any of the C++ files using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:

```sh
g++ -o binary_tree binary_tree.cpp

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-in-cpp.git

Installation
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```sh
Copy code
cd dsa-in-cpp
Compile any of the C++ files using your preferred C++ compiler. For example:

```sh
Copy code
g++ -o binary_tree binary_tree.cpp

Usage
Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own file. You can run the compiled executables to see how they work. For example, to run the binary tree implementation:
```sh
./binary_tree
